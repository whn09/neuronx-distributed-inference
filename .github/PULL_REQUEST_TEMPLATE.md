*Note: The below template includes items meant for model contributions only. For other contributions such as bug fixes, features, etc., only fill out the relevant portions of the form.*

## Description

*Provide a brief description of your contribution*

## Model Information

**Model Name:** *e.g., Llama 3.3*

**Model Architecture:** *e.g., Decoder-only transformer*

**Purpose:** *e.g., Text generation, image-to-text, etc.*

## Checklist

Please ensure your PR includes the following items. Refer to the [contrib/CONTRIBUTING.md](../contrib/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Required Components

- [ ] **Accuracy Test** (ex. `test/integration/test_model.py`)
  - At least one integration test that validates model accuracy
  - Uses logit validation or equivalent accuracy verification
  - Test can compile and run the model on Neuron

- [ ] **README.md** with the following sections:
  - [ ] **Usage Example**: Clear code example showing how to use the model
  - [ ] **Compatibility Matrix**: Table showing tested Neuron SDK versions and instance types (Trn1/Trn2/Inf2)
  - [ ] **Example Checkpoints**: Links to compatible model checkpoints (e.g., HuggingFace Hub)
  - [ ] **Testing Instructions**: Command to run the test suite for the model

- [ ] **Source Code** (`src/`)
  - Modeling code following NxD Inference patterns
  - Properly structured in the contrib folder hierarchy

### Optional Components

- [ ] **Unit Tests** (CPU or Neuron-based)
  - Tests for individual modeling components
  - Located in `test/unit/` directory

## Folder Structure

Confirm your contribution follows this structure:

```
