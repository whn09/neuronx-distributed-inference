Attention Kernel For Context Encoding (Prefill)

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:

Base Attention Algorithm:
The kernel computes: Output = softmax(scale * Q @ K^T) @ V

Breaking this down into steps:
  1. Compute attention scores: S = scale * Q @ K^T  (matmul, called MM1)
  2. Apply masking to S (causal, sliding window, etc.)
  3. Compute row-wise softmax: P = softmax(S) = exp(S - max(S)) / sum(exp(S - max(S)))
  4. Compute final output: O = P @ V  (matmul, called MM2)

The transpose flags (tp_q, tp_k, tp_out) control input/output tensor layouts without
changing the mathematical computation.

For a simple PyTorch reference implementation, see attention_cte_torch.py

FEATURES:

1. Causal Masking (causal_mask=True):
   - Masks upper triangle of attention scores: S[i,j] = -inf when i < j
   - Enables compute skipping: skip MM1/MM2 for upper triangle tiles

2. Sliding Window Attention (SWA, when sliding_window > 0):
   - Local attention: each query only attends to nearby keys within a window
   - Masks attention scores: S[i,j] = -inf when |i - j| > sliding_window
   - Currently only works with causal: masks both upper triangle AND positions outside window
   - When used with CP: loads only required KV slice to save memory

3. Context Parallelism (CP, global_cp_deg > 1, cp_offset is not None):
   - Distributes long sequence computation across multiple devices/ranks
   - Each rank (kernel call) processes a slice of Q sequence with full K/V
   - cp_offset indicates which Q slice this rank handles (runtime value)
   - Optionally supports strided Q slicing for better load balancing across CP ranks
   - Requires dynamic masking since offset unknown at compile time
   - Currently only supports causal attention

4. Prefix Caching (k_prior/v_prior provided):
   - K/V split into two parts: prior (cached) and active (current)
   - prior_used_len specifies how much of prior to use (dynamic mask)
   - Causal mask not required for prior portion (although we still apply SWA if applicable)

5. Sink Tokens (sink provided):
   - Add additional sink token to softmax denominator

6. Sequence Packing (bound_min/bound_max provided):
   - Multiple independent sequences are packed into a single tensor
   - Each query position has a [bound_min, bound_max) range defining which KV positions it attends to
   - Positions outside the range are masked with -inf, preventing cross-sequence attention
   - Compatible with causal masking (both masks are applied simultaneously)
   - Not compatible with prefix caching or context parallelism

7. Grouped Query Attention (GQA, batch_size_kv < batch_size):
   - Kernel handles GQA natively without explicit K/V replication

7. Support for training:
   - Kernel can optionally return maximum attention score and softmax denominator (per row) for backpropagation.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND LOOP STRUCTURE:

Level 1: LNC2 Sharding (on Trn2+)
  - Shards computation across 2 NeuronCores (LNC=2)
  - Primary sharding: Divides batch dimension evenly
  - Secondary sharding (for odd batch): Last batch item sharded on seqlen_q
    * Uses unequal split (65%/35%) for causal attention to balance load
    * Falls back to single core for short sequences (< 1024 tokens)

Level 2: Batch Loop
  - Iterates over batch items assigned to this core
  - Each batch item processes independently
  - For GQA: maps Q batch_id to correct KV batch_id

Level 3: Section Loop (Flash Attention for long sequences)
  - For K/V length > 10K tokens: divide into 8K-token sections
  - Process one section at a time to fit in SBUF memory
  - Maintains running statistics (max, sum) across sections
  - Final output computed using flash attention rescaling
  - For short sequences: single section contains all K/V
  - Check https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691
    for more details about flash attention.

Level 4: Group Loop (Q sequence processing)
  - Q sequence divided into groups of 128 tokens (_Q_GRP_SZ)
  - Each group processes independently within a section
  - Software pipelining: overlaps operations across groups (i, i+1, i+2)
    * Group i:   PV computation, writeback
    * Group i+1: Exp computation
    * Group i+2: Q load, QK computation
  - Uses modular allocation for efficient buffer reuse

INTENDED USAGE:

The kernel supports sequence lengths up to 36864 and is optimized for q sequence
length larger than ~256 (i.e., prefill/context encoding workloads). The head dimension (d)
can be up to 128. Batch size up to 16 has been tested.

Input dtypes can be bfloat16, float16 or float32. The kernel uses float32 for softmax and
bfloat16 for other operations.

      cp_offset (nt.tensor, optional): Context parallel offset tensor with shape (1, 1)
      global_cp_deg (int, optional): Global context parallel degree
      cp_strided_q_slicing (bool, optional): Whether Q is strided for load balancing (default False)
      bound_min (nt.tensor, optional): (Sequence packing) Per-query lower bound (inclusive) of the KV range
                     to attend to, with shape (seqlen_q, 1). Query position i attends only to KV positions j
                     where bound_min[i] <= j < bound_max[i]. Must be provided together with bound_max.
                     Not compatible with prefix caching or context parallelism.
      bound_max (nt.tensor, optional): (Sequence packing) Per-query upper bound (exclusive) of the KV range
                     to attend to, with shape (seqlen_q, 1). Must be provided together with bound_min.

    Returns:
      Output tensor with attention results. Shape depends on tp_out parameter.
      If cache_softmax is True, returns tuple of (output, out_neg_max, out_sum_recip).

    IO Shapes:
      - q:
        (batch_size, seqlen_q, d) when tp_q is True
        (batch_size, d, seqlen_q) when tp_q is False
      - k:
        (batch_size_kv, seqlen_kv, d) when tp_k is True
        (batch_size_kv, d, seqlen_kv) when tp_k is False
      - v: (batch_size_kv, seqlen_kv, d)
      - returns output with shape:
        (batch_size, d, seqlen_q) if tp_out is True
        (batch_size, seqlen_q, d) if tp_out is False

      - The math performed is softmax(q @ k) @ v (details described in top-level documentation)

    Prefix Caching:
      If k_prior, v_prior and prior_used_len are specified for prefix caching, the
      computation is equivalent to prepending the prior k/v (up to prior_used_len)
      behind the active k/v and shifting the mask accordingly. The shapes of k_prior
      and v_prior must match the shapes of k and v respectively on the non-seqlen
      dimensions, while the shape of prior_used_len is (1,). By setting prior_used_len,
      the actual prefix length can be chosen dynamically at runtime (up to seqlen_prior).

    MHA and Native GQA Support:
      For MHA attention, the heads can be included as part of the batch dimension.
      For GQA, when batch_size_kv < batch_size, we expect that batch_size % batch_size_kv == 0,
      and the computation is equivalent to first applying torch_interleave on K and V.
      Note that GQA typically applies to nheads dimension but the kernel combines
      batch and nheads dimensions.

    Softmax Caching (useful during training):
      When cache_softmax is True and out_neg_max/out_sum_recip are provided, returns
      the negative max and reciprocal sum in the softmax with shapes:
        padded_seq_grps = ceil(seqlen_q / 128) (_Q_GRP_SZ = 128)
        neg_max: (batch_size, 128, padded_seq_grps)
        recip: (batch_size, 128, padded_seq_grps)

    Context Parallel Support:
      Enabled when global_cp_deg is set. Since the Q seqlen offset is usually not
      known at compile time (based on rank ID), it is expected to be a (1, 1) HBM
      input to the kernel. global_cp_deg (a compile time constant int) denotes total
      number of ranks / CP degree.

      When cp_strided_q_slicing is False, this indicates FAL has sharded Q into contiguous chunks.
      In this case, cp_offset should be passed as rank_id * partial_q_seqlen

      When cp_strided_q_slicing is True, this indicates Q has been sharded in row-strided manner
      where stride is global_cp_deg. In this case, cp_offset should be passed as rank_id. Note that
      K & V are still assumed to be contiguous.

      As an example for seqlen_q=4, seqlen_kv=12, global_cp_deg=3, rank_id = 1:
        cp_strided_q_slicing False => q seqlen slice is [4, 5, 6, 7] and cp_offset is 4.
        cp_strided_q_slicing True  => q seqlen slice is [1, 4, 7, 10] and cp_offset is 1.
        In both cases, KV token order is simply [0, 1, 2, ..., 10, 11]

    Pseudocode:

      for each batch in batch_size:
        for each section in K/V (flash attention sectioning):

            # MM1: Compute attention scores
            scores = Q @ K^T * scale

    Internal implementation function for attention computation.

    This function processes a single batch and handles the core attention computation
    with flash attention optimization, sectioning, and various masking strategies.

    Args:
      q, k_active, v_active: Input tensors
      k_prior, v_prior, prior_used_len: Prefix caching tensors
      o: Output tensor
      batch_id, batch_id_kv: Batch indices
      ac: High-level attention configuration
      sink: Optional sink token tensor
      out_neg_max, out_sum_recip: Optional softmax cache outputs
      shard_seqlen_q_start, shard_seqlen_q_length: Seqlen sharding parameters
      cp_offset: Context parallel offset tensor

    High-level logic:
    For large enough K/V length, we divide the K/V into sections of 8k.

    For each section:
      a. Load K and V to SBUF
      b. Loop over Q (groups) - each group has seqlen 128 (_Q_GRP_SZ)
      c. Within each group:
        i.   Load Q
        ii.  Compute QK^T (MM1) and max
        iii. Compute exponential and transpose
        iv.  Compute PV (MM2)
        v.   Write to output

    Handling multiple sections:
      We keep running max, sum, etc. buffers that we keep updating as we go through
      sections and use these to update the output using flash attention.

    Pipelining:
      To maximize utilization of the hw engines, we use software pipelining to
      inform scheduler decisions. This means we manually interleave iterations of
      the group loop to make sure certain operations of group i+2 should start even
      as group i is being processed. In addition we use modulo allocation for tensors
      to enable pipelining across Q groups and K/V tiles within a section.
